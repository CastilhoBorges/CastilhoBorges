## üöÄ About Me  

Fullstack Developer | Node | TypeScript | AWS | Java | Next.js

Software Developer with experience in creating, maintaining, and evolving critical B2B applications. My role extends beyond coding; I actively participate in strategic product decisions, ensuring that developed solutions align with business and client needs.

I'm proficient in the Node.js and Java ecosystems, with experience in microservices architectures and deployment on AWS cloud. I have practical experience with essential services like S3, EC2, SQS, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, and CloudWatch, optimizing application performance and scalability. I've worked with Next.js to build dynamic, high-performance interfaces, in addition to Postgres (relational) and MongoDB (non-relational) databases, and caching services like Redis, to build robust and efficient systems.

My work methodology is based on software engineering best practices and the creation of comprehensive automated tests. I'm experienced in building CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, ensuring continuous and high-quality deliveries.

Beyond my technical skills, my soft skills are a key differentiator: I'm organized, creative (also acting as a content creator), resilient in the face of complex challenges, and possess clear and effective communication. My ability to maintain a critical perspective allows me to identify and propose continuous improvements in processes and products, adding significant value to the teams and projects I join.
