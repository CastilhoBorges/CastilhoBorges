## üöÄ About Me  

Junior Full Stack Developer | Node | TypeScript | NestJS | Next.js | AWS

I‚Äôm a full stack developer with a strong focus on backend development, dedicated to building efficient and scalable web solutions. My core expertise lies in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, where I develop robust applications using NestJS, complemented by frontend skills with Next.js.

I also have previous experience with C# in developing RESTful APIs. I work with both SQL databases (PostgreSQL, using TypeORM) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB), choosing the most suitable technology for each project requirement.

On the cloud infrastructure side, I implement scalable architectures using AWS services such as S3, EC2, and SQS. My workflow includes DevOps practices with CI/CD pipelines, performance optimization with Redis caching, and integration of messaging systems like SQS and Kafka. I ensure software quality through automated testing with Jest and have experience in both Windows and Linux environments.

Beyond technical skills, I stand out for my time management, creativity (reflected in my work as a content creator), resilience, effective communication, and critical thinking.

I‚Äôm always seeking new challenges where I can apply and expand my backend skills, contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry.
