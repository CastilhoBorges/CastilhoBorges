## üöÄ About Me  

Full Stack Developer | Node | TypeScript | AWS | NestJS | Next.js

I am a full stack developer with a strong focus on backend, passionate about creating efficient and scalable web solutions that truly make a difference in people‚Äôs and companies‚Äô daily lives. My main expertise is in the Node.js ecosystem, where I use NestJS to build robust and secure applications. On the frontend, I have experience with Next.js, which allows me to deliver complete projects, from the database to the user interface.

I have also worked with C#, developing REST APIs, and I am comfortable working with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, always choosing the best technology for each challenge.

On the infrastructure side, I work with AWS, implementing scalable and resilient architectures using services like S3, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, and SQS. I care deeply about the quality of what I deliver, so I invest in automated testing and best development practices. I have experience in both Windows and Linux environments.

Beyond technical skills, I believe soft skills make all the difference: I am organized, creative (I also work as a content creator), resilient in the face of challenges, communicate clearly, and have a critical eye for suggesting improvements.

I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to grow, learn, and contribute to innovative projects.
